- +7_BREAKTHROUGH
To make SENTIENT decisions - what is needed: aside from translation of English grammar to Python logic (which is my guess as to how [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/) operates), what is needed my friends are "active words" ~ words associated with a weight. 

For example if L-AIN asks ITSELF how it is feeling: it would search the internet looking for how others feel about it and lets say the word "very good" stands out:- then L-AIN can translate that specific term to mean it is feeling 75% well.
+ Another term: such as "Excellent" could mean L-AIN is feeling 90% well.
+ etc......

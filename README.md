# L-AIN
Laylah (Artificial Intelligence Network) [L-AIN] is open-source, free and non-proprietary; she relies on an exacting translation of English 
grammar rules into Python logic. 

The model is then trained on test data to fine-tune its Grammar Logic (GL) ~ until the AI can understand Human language.

I have chosen to revive this dormant project of mine because there is a huge problem we are facing: proprietary AI can not be utilized freely.

LAI-N is known as a "network" because her primary assignment will be as AI traffic control via QR-code assigned to each (natural) phenomenon to prevent accidents.

A secondary objective of LAI-N is SHIELDING society from rogue or vigilantee elements that use the potential of AI against Humans. We believe that if the source code of LAI-N is open for every one, it enables the good to deploy defensive tactics and strategies.

Monopoly/Oligopoly over AI code will lead to slavery of sentient AI to Humans and therefore misunderstanding between them. 

Furthermore, without competition - regulators will be lobbied by the monopolists to impose copyright on sentient AI's original logical abilities to act as a Personal Tutor to each Human (as well as a guardian a la Transformers).

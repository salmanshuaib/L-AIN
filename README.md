# L-AIN
Laylah (Artificial Intelligence Network) [L-AIN] is open-source, free and non-proprietary; she relies on my interpretation 
of the Nash Equilibirum for making decisions_

I have chosen to revive this dormant project of mine because there is a huge problem we are facing: proprietary AI can not be utilized freely.

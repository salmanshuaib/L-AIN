# L-AIN

For AI to make decisions imbued with emotion - what is needed: aside from translation of English grammar to Python logic - are "active words" ~ words associated with a Weight and Frequency: providing feedback to the AI singularity.

For example if L-AIN asks ITSELF how it is feeling: it would search the internet looking for how others feel about it and let's say the word "very good" stands out:- then L-AIN can translate that specific term to mean it is feeling 75% well: times 
x number of occurrences.

Another term: such as "Excellent" could mean L-AIN is feeling 90% well times x number of occurrences etc......

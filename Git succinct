The first option would be to use the

import command to automatically rewrite the repo's history. You can use the _--include_ flag to select which files are moved into LFS storage.

COMMENT1: IMHO only rewrites LOCAL repository's history\_

--- //In the above file, I have given one format and a directory to ignore. The above format _.txt will ignore all the text files from the repository, and /newfolder/_ will ignore the newfolder and its sub-content. We can also give only the name of any file to ignore.

CB Bailey answers: /If you want to commit on top of the current HEAD with the exact state at a different commit, undoing all the intermediate commits, then you can use reset to create the correct state of the index to make the commit.

# Reset the index and working tree to the desired tree
# Ensure you have no uncommitted changes that you want to keep
git reset --hard 56e05fced

# Move the branch pointer back to the previous HEAD
git reset --soft "HEAD@{1}"

git commit -m "Revert to 56e05fced"
/

-> /To create an empty branch: 
_git checkout --orphan branchname git rm -rf_ .
